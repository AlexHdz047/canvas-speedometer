h2. Canvas Speedometer

This is a simple speedometer widget implemented using the standard HTML5 Canvas APIs.

It has been tested on Webkit (Safari/Chrome) and Gecko (Firefox/Iceweasel/...). It currently doesn't work on IE.

You can watch a demo "here":http://thebinaryelevator.com/t/speedometer.html.
